# weather-app
## Project Description
SimpleWeather is a basic weather application that provides users with real-time weather information for a specified location. Users can input the city or use their device's location to get current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant details.
### Motivation:
The motivation behind SimpleWeather is to create a user-friendly and straightforward weather application that allows users to quickly access up-to-date weather information. This project aims to provide a practical example of working with APIs and handling JSON data in a web or mobile application.
### Solution
Creating a weather app is a great project that involves fetching real-time data and presenting it in a user-friendly interface.
### Features
- Set up push notifications or alerts for severe weather conditions in the user's selected locations.
- Implement a caching mechanism to allow users to access previously fetched weather data when offline.
